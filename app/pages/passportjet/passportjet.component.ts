We know that our clients are busy and that plans may materialize at the last minute, so we have guaranteed availability with 4 hours notice and also offer a flexible cancellation policy. We provide complimentary use of our private air terminals and conference rooms to make your travel even easier. Save money and time with Rectrix – there are no surcharges for fuel, ever, and we provide complimentary concierge services.";
